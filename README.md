###Class Association Example of Aggregation

Aggregation vs Composition
An association between two class is considered <b>Aggregation</b> when both classes can exist independently of each other. Alternatively, if one of the classes is dependent on the other to exist then the association is considered <b>Composition</b>.

In this case, Teacher.java and Student.java HAS-A Address.java

Driver class - Main.java (Sibling class)
Concrete Class - Address.java (Sibling class)
Concrete Class - Student.java (Sibling class)
Concrete Class - Teacher.java (Sibling class)
