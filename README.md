In this case, Teacher.java and Student.java <b>HAS-A</b> Address.java
<br>
<br>
<b>Driver class - Main.java &nbsp;&nbsp</b>(Sibling class)<br>
<b>Concrete Class - Address.java</b>&nbsp&nbsp(Sibling class)<br>
<b>Concrete Class - Student.java</b>&nbsp&nbsp(Sibling class)<br>
<b>Concrete Class - Teacher.java</b>&nbsp&nbsp(Sibling class)<br>
